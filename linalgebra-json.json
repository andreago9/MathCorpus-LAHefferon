The help that it gives to\nstudentscomesfromtakingadevelopmentalapproach—thisbook’spresentation\nemphasizes motivation and naturalness, using many examples.\nThe developmental approach is what most recommends this book so I will\nelaborate. Courses at the beginning of a mathematics program focus less on\ntheoryandmoreoncalculating. Latercoursesaskformathematicalmaturity:the\nability to follow different types of arguments, a familiarity with the themes that\nunderlie many mathematical investigations such as elementary set and function\nfacts,andacapacityforsomeindependentreadingandthinking. Someprograms\nhave a separate course devoted to developing maturity but in any case a Linear\nAlgebra course is an ideal spot to work on this transition. It comes early in a\nprogram so that progress made here pays off later but it also comes late enough\nso that the classroom contains only students who are serious about mathematics.\nThe material is accessible, coherent, and elegant. And, examples are plentiful.\nHelping readers with their transition requires taking the mathematics seri-\nously. All of the results here are proved. On the other hand, we cannot assume\nthat students have already arrived and so in contrast with more advanced\ntexts this book is filled with illustrations of the theory, often quite detailed\nillustrations.\nSome texts that assume a not-yet sophisticated reader begin with matrix\nmultiplication and determinants.

The first chapter includes proofs, such as\nthe proof that linear reduction gives a correct and complete solution set. With\nthat as motivation the second chapter does vector spaces over the reals. In the\nschedule below this happens at the start of the third week.\nA student progresses most in mathematics by doing exercises. The problem\nsets start with routine checks and range up to reasonably involved proofs. I\nhave aimed to typically put two dozen in each set, thereby giving a selection.

Linear Systems\n1.5 Theorem (Gauss’s Method) If a linear system is changed to another by one of\nthese operations\n(1) an equation is swapped with another\n(2) an equation has both sides multiplied by a nonzero constant\n(3) an equation is replaced by the sum of itself and a multiple of another\nthen the two systems have the same set of solutions.\nEach of the three operations has a restriction. Multiplying a row by 0 is not\nallowed because obviously that can change the solution set.

They are\nswapping, multiplying by a scalar (or rescaling), and row combination.\nWhen writing out the calculations, we will abbreviate ‘row i’ by ‘ρ ’ (this is\ni\nthe Greek letter rho, pronounced aloud as “row”). For instance, we will denote\na row combination operation by kρ +ρ , with the row that changes written\ni j\nsecond. To save writing we will often combine addition steps when they use the\nsame ρ , as in the next example.\ni\n1.7 Example Gauss’s Method systematically applies the row operations to solve\na system. Here is a typical case.\nx+ y =0\n2x− y+3z=3\nx−2y− z=3\nWe begin by using the first row to eliminate the 2x in the second row and the x\nin the third. To get rid of the 2x we mentally multiply the entire first row by\n−2, add that to the second row, and write the result in as the new second row.\nTo eliminate the x in the third row we multiply the first row by −1, add that to\nthe third row, and write the result in as the new third row.\nx+ y =0\n−2 −ρ1→+ρ2\n−3y+3z=3\n−ρ1+ρ3\n−3y− z=3\nWe finish by transforming the second system into a third, where the bottom\nequation involves only one unknown. We do that by using the second row to\neliminate the y term from the third row.\nx+ y =0\n−ρ −2→+ρ3\n−3y+ 3z=3\n−4z=0\nNow finding the system’s solution is easy. The third row gives z=0. Substitute\nthat back into the second row to get y=−1. Then substitute back into the first\nrow to get x=1.\n1.8 Example For the Physics problem from the start of this chapter, Gauss’s\nMethod gives this.\n40h+15c=100 5/4 −ρ →1+ρ2 40h+ 15c=100\n−50h+25c= 50 (175/4)c=175\nSo c=4, and back-substitution gives that h=1.

But it does suggest the\nsecond point about the proof, its approach. The example moves row-by-row up\nthe system, using the equations from lower rows to do the next row. This points\nto doing the proof by mathematical induction.∗\nInduction is an important and non-obvious proof technique that we shall\nuse a number of times in this book. We will do proofs by induction in two\nsteps, a base step and an inductive step. In the base step we verify that the\nstatement is true for some first instance, here that for the bottom equation we\ncan write the leading variable in terms of free variables. In the inductive step\nwe must establish an implication, that if the statement is true for all prior cases\nthen it follows for the present case also. Here we will establish that if for the\nbottom-most t rows we can express the leading variables in terms of the free\nvariables, then for the t+1-th row from the bottom we can also express the\nleading variable in terms of those that are free.\nThose two steps together prove the statement for all the rows because by\nthe base step it is true for the bottom equation, and by the inductive step the\nfact that it is true for the bottom equation shows that it is true for the next one\nup. Then another application of the inductive step implies that it is true for the\nthird equation up, etc.\nProof Apply Gauss’s Method to get to echelon form.

But because\nthe system is homogeneous there are no contradictory equations.\nWe will use induction to verify that each leading variable can be expressed\nin terms of free variables. That will finish the proof because we can use the free\nvariables as parameters and the β(cid:126)’s are the vectors of coefficients of those free\nvariables.\nFor the base step consider the bottom-most equation\na x +a x +···+a x =0 (∗)\nm,(cid:96)m (cid:96)m m,(cid:96)m+1 (cid:96)m+1 m,n n\nwhere a (cid:54)= 0.

(There is a tricky\ntechnical point here: if in the bottom equation (∗) there are no variables to\nthe right of x then x = 0. This satisfies the statement we are verifying\nlm (cid:96)m\nbecause, as alluded to at the start of this subsection, it has x written as a\n(cid:96)m\nsum of a number of the free variables, namely as the sum of zero many, under\nthe convention that a trivial sum totals to 0.)\nFor the inductive step assume that the statement holds for the bottom-most\nt rows, with 0 (cid:54) t < m−1. That is, assume that for the m-th equation, and\nthe (m−1)-th equation, etc., up to and including the (m−t)-th equation, we\ncan express the leading variable in terms of free ones. We must verify that\nthis then also holds for the next equation up, the (m−(t+1))-th equation.\nFor that, take each variable that leads in a lower equation x , ..., x and\n(cid:96)m (cid:96)m−t\nsubstitute its expression in terms of free variables.

What was the wind’s velocity?\n1.11 Euclid describes a plane as “a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines\non itself”. Commentators such as Heron have interpreted this to mean, “(A plane\nsurface is) such that, if a straight line pass through two points on it, the line\ncoincides wholly with it at every spot, all ways”. (Translations from [Heath], pp.\n171-172.) Do planes, as described in this section, have that property? Does this\ndescription adequately define planes?\nII.2 Length and Angle Measures\nWe’ve translated the first section’s results about solution sets into geometric\nterms, to better understand those sets.

Rather, we must ensure that the names\nsuit the sets. While we can’t prove that the sets satisfy our intuition—we\ncan’t prove anything about intuition—in this subsection we’ll observe that a\nresult familiar from R2 and R3, when generalized to arbitrary Rn, supports the\nidea that a line is straight and a plane is flat. Specifically, we’ll see how to do\nEuclidean geometry in a ‘plane’ by giving a definition of the angle between two\nRn vectors, in the plane that they generate.\n2.1Definition The length of a vector(cid:126)v∈Rn is the square root of the sum of the\nsquares of its components.\n(cid:113)\n|(cid:126)v|= v2+···+v2\n1 n\n2.2 Remark This is a natural generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem.

We proceed by\ninduction on that number.\nIn the base step, that we can go from one matrix to another using zero\nreduction operations, the two are equal.

Consider a matrix B such that reducing A to B\nrequires k+1 operations. In that reduction there is a next-to-last matrix G, so\nthat A−→···−→G−→B. The inductive hypothesis applies to this G because\nit is only k steps away from A. That is, each row of G is a linear combination of\nthe rows of A.\nWe will verify that the rows of B are linear combinations of the rows of G.\nThen the Linear Combination Lemma, Lemma 2.3, applies to show that the\nrows of B are linear combinations of the rows of A.\nIf the row operation taking G to B is a swap then the rows of B are just the\nrows of G reordered and each row of B is a linear combination of the rows of G.\nIf the operation taking G to B is multiplication of a row by a scalar cρ then\ni\nβ(cid:126) = c(cid:126)γ and the other rows are unchanged.

But of course its goal is to end in echelon form, since that is a\nparticularly basic version of a linear system, as it has isolated the variables. For\ninstance, in this matrix\n \n2 3 7 8 0 0\n0 0 1 5 1 1\nR= \n0 0 0 3 3 0\n \n0 0 0 0 2 1\nx has been removed from x ’s equation.

We sometimes refer to\nGauss’s Method as Gaussian elimination. What it eliminates is linear relation-\nships among the rows.\n2.5 Lemma In an echelon form matrix, no nonzero row is a linear combination\nof the other nonzero rows.\nProof Let R be an echelon form matrix and consider its non-(cid:126)0 rows. First\nobserve that if we have a row written as a combination of the others (cid:126)ρ =\ni\nc (cid:126)ρ +···+c (cid:126)ρ +c (cid:126)ρ +···+c (cid:126)ρ thenwecanrewritethatequation\n1 1 i−1 i−1 i+1 i+1 m m\nas\n(cid:126)0=c (cid:126)ρ +···+c (cid:126)ρ +c (cid:126)ρ +c (cid:126)ρ +···+c (cid:126)ρ (∗)\n1 1 i−1 i−1 i i i+1 i+1 m m\nwhere not all the coefficients are zero; specifically, c =−1. The converse holds\ni\nalso: given equation (∗) where some c (cid:54)=0 we could express(cid:126)ρ as a combination\ni i\nof the other rows by moving c (cid:126)ρ to the left and dividing by −c . Therefore we\ni i i\nwill have proved the theorem if we show that in (∗) all of the coefficients are 0.\nFor that we use induction on the row number i.\nThe base case is the first row i=1 (if there is no such nonzero row, so that\nR is the zero matrix, then the lemma holds vacuously). Let (cid:96) be the column\ni\nnumber of the leading entry in row i. Consider the entry of each row that is in\ncolumn (cid:96) .

QED\nWith that, we are ready to show that the end product of Gauss-Jordan\nreduction is unique.\n2.6 Theorem Each matrix is row equivalent to a unique reduced echelon form\nmatrix.\nProof [Yuster] Fix a number of rows m. We will proceed by induction on the\nnumber of columns n.\nThe base case is that the matrix has n=1 column. If this is the zero matrix\nthen its echelon form is the zero matrix. If instead it has any nonzero entries\nthen when the matrix is brought to reduced echelon form it must have at least\none nonzero entry, which must be a 1 in the first row. Either way, its reduced\nechelon form is unique.\nFor the inductive step we assume that n > 1 and that all m row matrices\nhaving fewer than n columns have a unique reduced echelon form. Consider\nan m×n matrix A and suppose that B and C are two reduced echelon form\nmatrices derived from A. We will show that these two must be equal.\nLet Aˆ be the matrix consisting of the first n−1 columns of A. Observe\nthat any sequence of row operations that bring A to reduced echelon form will\nalso bring Aˆ to reduced echelon form. By the inductive hypothesis this reduced\nechelon form of Aˆ is unique, so if B and C differ then the difference must occur\nin column n.\nWe finish the inductive step and the argument by showing that the two\ncannot differ only in that column.

And, both leading entries would have to be 1, and would have to be the\nonly nonzero entries in that column. Therefore B=C. QED\nWehaveaskedwhetheranytwoechelonformversionsofalinearsystemhave\nthe same number of free variables, and if so are they exactly the same variables?\nWith the prior result we can answer both questions “yes.” There is no linear\nsystem such that, say, we could apply Gauss’s Method one way and get y and z\nfree but apply it another way and get y and w free.\nBeforetheproof, recall thedistinctionbetweenfreevariablesandparameters.\nThis system\nx+y =1\ny+z=2\nhas one free variable, z, because it is the only variable not leading a row. We\nhavethehabitofparametrizingusingthefreevariabley=2−z,x=−1+z,but\nwe could also parametrize using another variable, such as z=2−y, x=1−y.\nSo the set of parameters is not unique, it is the set of free variables that is\nunique.\n2.7 Corollary If from a starting linear systems we derive by Gauss’s Method two\ndifferent echelon form systems, then the two have the same free variables.\nProof The prior result says that the reduced echelon form is unique. We get\nfrom any echelon form version to the reduced echelon form by eliminating up, so\nany echelon form version of a system has the same free variables as the reduced\nechelon form version.

Economists have struggled to\nbe able to describe, and to make predictions about, such a complicated object.\nMathematical models using systems of linear equations are a key tool. One\nexample is Input-Output Analysis, pioneered by W. Leontief, who won the 1973\nNobel Prize in Economics.\nConsider an economy with many parts, two of which are the steel industry\nand the auto industry. These two interact tightly as they work to meet the\ndemand for their product from other parts of the economy, from users external\ntothesteelandautosectors. Forinstance, shouldtheexternaldemandforautos\ngo up, that would increase in the auto industry’s usage of steel. Or should the\nexternal demand for steel fall, then it would lower steel’s purchase of trucks.\nThe model that we consider here takes in the external demands and predicts\nhow the two interact to meet those demands.\nWe start with production and consumption statistics. (These numbers,\ngiving dollar values in millions, are from [Leontief 1965] describing the 1958 U.S.\neconomy. Today’s statistics would be different because of inflation and because\nof technical changes in the industries.)\nused by used by used by\nsteel auto others total\nvalue of\n5395 2664 25448\nsteel\nvalue of\n48 9030 30346\nauto\nFor instance, the dollar value of steel used by the auto industry in this year is\n2,664 million. Note that industries may consume some of their own output.\nWe can fill in the external demands. This year’s value of the steel used by\nothers is 17,389 and the external value of autos is 21,268. With that we have a\ncomplete description of how auto and steel interact to meet their demands."

We also\nestimate that next year’s external demand for autos will be down 25 to 21,243.\nWe wish to predict next year’s total outputs.\nThat prediction isn’t as simple as adding 200 to this year’s steel total and\nsubtracting 25 from this year’s auto total. For one thing, a rise in steel will\ncause that industry to have an increased demand for autos, which will mitigate\nthe loss in external demand for autos. On the other hand, the drop in external\ndemand for autos will cause the auto industry to use less steel and so lessen\nsomewhat the upswing in steel’s business. In short, these two industries form a\nsystem. We must predict where the system as a whole will settle.\nHere are the equations.\nnext year’s production of steel=next year’s use of steel by steel\n+next year’s use of steel by auto\n+next year’s use of steel by others\nnext year’s production of autos=next year’s use of autos by steel\n+next year’s use of autos by auto\n+next year’s use of autos by others\nFor the left side let s be next years total production of steel and let a be next\nyear’s total output of autos. For the right side, as discussed above, our external\ndemand estimates are 17,589 and 21,243.\nFor next year’s use of steel by steel, note that this year the steel industry\nused 5,395 units of steel input to produce 25,448 units of steel output. So next\nyear, when the steel industry will produce s units out, we guess that doing so\nwill take s·(5395)/(25448) units of steel input—this is simply the assumption\nthatinputisproportionaltooutput. (Weareassumingthattheratioofinputto\noutput remains constant over time; in practice, models may try to take account\nof trends of change in the ratios.)\nNext year’s use of steel by the auto industry is similar.

Comparing these predictions to the numbers for the current year shows\nthat the total production of the steel industry should rise by 250 while auto’s\ntotal drops by 35. The increase in external demand for steel causes an increase\nin internal demand by the steel industry, which is lessened somewhat by the\ndrop in autos, but results in a total that is more than 200 higher. Similarly,\nauto’s total drops more than 25 despite the help that it gets from steel.\nOne of the advantages of having a mathematical model is that we can ask\n“What if ...?” questions. For instance, we can ask, “What if our estimates for\nnext year’s external demands are somewhat off?” To try to understand how\nmuch the model’s predictions change in reaction to changes in our estimates,\nwe can revise the estimate of next year’s external steel demand from 17,589\ndown to 17,489, while keeping the assumption of next year’s external demand\nfor autos fixed at 21,243.

We are seeing\nhowsensitivethepredictionsofourmodelaretotheaccuracyoftheassumptions.\nNaturally, we can consider larger models that detail the interactions among\nmore sectors of an economy; these models are typically solved on a computer.\nNaturally also, a single model does not suit every case and assuring that the\nassumptions underlying a model are reasonable for a particular prediction\nrequires the judgments of experts. With those caveats however, this model has\nproven in practice to be a useful and accurate tool for economic analysis.

It systematically takes linear combinations of the rows.\nHere we move to a general study of linear combinations.\nWe need a setting. At times in the first chapter we’ve combined vectors from\nR2, at other times vectors from R3, and at other times vectors from higher-\ndimensional spaces. So our first impulse might be to work in Rn, leaving n\nunspecified. This would have the advantage that any of the results would hold\nfor R2 and for R3 and for many other spaces, simultaneously.\nBut if having the results apply to many spaces at once is advantageous then\nstickingonlytoRn’sisrestrictive. We’dlikeourresultstoapplytocombinations\nof row vectors, as in the final section of the first chapter. We’ve even seen some\nspaces that are not simply a collection of all of the same-sized column vectors or\nrow vectors. For instance, we’ve seen a homogeneous system’s solution set that\nis a plane inside of R3. This set is a closed system in that a linear combination\nof these solutions is also a solution. But it does not contain all of the three-tall\ncolumn vectors, only some of them.\nWe want the results about linear combinations to apply anywhere that linear\ncombinations make sense. We shall call any such set a vector space. Our results,\ninstead of being phrased as “Whenever we have a collection in which we can\nsensibly take linear combinations ...”, will be stated “In any vector space ...”\nSuch a statement describes at once what happens in many spaces. To\nunderstand the advantages of moving from studying a single space to studying\na class of spaces, consider this analogy. Imagine that the government made\nlaws one person at a time: “Leslie Jones can’t jay walk.” That would be bad;\nstatements have the virtue of economy when they apply to many cases at once.\nOr suppose that they said, “Kim Ke must stop when passing an accident.”\nContrast that with, “Any doctor must stop when passing an accident.” More\ngeneral statements, in some ways, are clearer."

Vector Spaces\nI Definition of Vector Space\nWe shall study structures with two operations, an addition and a scalar multi-\nplication, that are subject to some simple conditions. We will reflect more on\nthe conditions later but on first reading notice how reasonable they are. For\ninstance,surelyanyoperationthatcanbecalledanaddition(e.g.,columnvector\naddition, row vector addition, or real number addition) will satisfy conditions\n(1) through (5) below.\nI.1 Definition and Examples\n1.1 Definition A vector space (over R) consists of a set V along with two\noperations ‘+’ and ‘·’ subject to the conditions that for all vectors(cid:126)v,w(cid:126),(cid:126)u∈V\nand all scalars r,s∈R:\n(1) the set V is closed under vector addition, that is,(cid:126)v+w(cid:126) ∈V\n(2) vector addition is commutative,(cid:126)v+w(cid:126) =w(cid:126) +(cid:126)v\n(3) vector addition is associative, ((cid:126)v+w(cid:126))+(cid:126)u=(cid:126)v+(w(cid:126) +(cid:126)u)\n(4) there is a zero vector (cid:126)0∈V such that(cid:126)v+(cid:126)0=(cid:126)v for all(cid:126)v∈V\n(5) each(cid:126)v∈V has an additive inverse w(cid:126) ∈V such that w(cid:126) +(cid:126)v=(cid:126)0\n(6) the set V is closed under scalar multiplication, that is, r·(cid:126)v∈V\n(7) scalarmultiplicationdistributesoverscalaraddition, (r+s)·(cid:126)v=r·(cid:126)v+s·(cid:126)v\n(8) scalarmultiplicationdistributesovervectoraddition,r·((cid:126)v+w(cid:126))=r·(cid:126)v+r·w(cid:126)\n(9) ordinary multiplication of scalars associates with scalar multiplication,\n(rs)·(cid:126)v=r·(s·(cid:126)v)\n(10) multiplication by the scalar 1 is the identity operation, 1·(cid:126)v=(cid:126)v.\n1.2 Remark The definition involves two kinds of addition and two kinds of\nmultiplication, and so may at first seem confused. For instance, in condition (7)\nthe ‘+’ on the left is addition of two real numbers while the ‘+’ on the right\nis addition of two vectors in V. These expressions aren’t ambiguous because\nof context; for example, r and s are real numbers so ‘r+s’ can only mean\nreal number addition. In the same way, item (9)’s left side ‘rs’ is ordinary real\nnumber multiplication, while its right side ‘s·(cid:126)v’ is the scalar multiplication\ndefined for this vector space.\nThebestwaytounderstandthedefinitionistogothroughtheexamplesbelow\nand for each, check all ten conditions.

This definition is shaped\nso that it contains the conditions needed to prove all of the interesting and\nimportant properties of spaces of linear combinations. As we proceed, we shall\nderive all of the properties natural to collections of linear combinations from the\nconditions given in the definition.\nThe next result is an example. We do not need to include these properties\nin the definition of vector space because they follow from the properties already\nlisted there.\n1.16Lemma InanyvectorspaceV,forany(cid:126)v∈V andr∈R,wehave(1)0·(cid:126)v=(cid:126)0,\n(2) (−1·(cid:126)v)+(cid:126)v=(cid:126)0, and (3) r·(cid:126)0=(cid:126)0.\nProof For (1) note that (cid:126)v = (1+0)·(cid:126)v =(cid:126)v+(0·(cid:126)v). Add to both sides the\nadditive inverse of(cid:126)v, the vector w(cid:126) such that w(cid:126) +(cid:126)v=(cid:126)0.\nw(cid:126) +(cid:126)v=w(cid:126) +(cid:126)v+0·(cid:126)v\n(cid:126)0=(cid:126)0+0·(cid:126)v\n(cid:126)0=0·(cid:126)v\nItem (2) is easy: (−1·(cid:126)v)+(cid:126)v=(−1+1)·(cid:126)v=0·(cid:126)v=(cid:126)0. For (3), r·(cid:126)0=r·(0·(cid:126)0)=\n(r·0)·(cid:126)0=(cid:126)0 will do. QED\nThe second item shows that we can write the additive inverse of(cid:126)v as ‘−(cid:126)v’\nwithout worrying about any confusion with (−1)·(cid:126)v.\nA recap: our study in Chapter One of Gaussian reduction led us to consider\ncollections of linear combinations. So in this chapter we have defined a vector\nspace to be a structure in which we can form such combinations, subject to\nsimple conditions on the addition and scalar multiplication operations. In a\nphrase: vector spaces are the right context in which to study linearity.\nFrom the fact that it forms a whole chapter, and especially because that\nchapter is the first one, a reader could suppose that our purpose in this book is\nthe study of linear systems. The truth is that we will not so much use vector\nspaces in the study of linear systems as we instead have linear systems start us\nonthestudyofvectorspaces. Thewidevarietyofexamplesfromthissubsection\nshows that the study of vector spaces is interesting and important in its own\nright. Linear systems won’t go away.

This\nfits the intuition that a good way to think of a vector space is as a collection in\nwhich linear combinations are sensible.\nTaken together, Lemma 2.9 and Lemma 2.15 show that the span of a subset\nS of a vector space is the smallest subspace containing all of the members of S.\n2.16 Example In any vector space V, for any vector(cid:126)v∈V, the set {r·(cid:126)v|r∈R}\nis a subspace of V. For instance, for any vector (cid:126)v ∈ R3 the line through the\norigin containing that vector {k(cid:126)v|k∈R} is a subspace of R3.

        "content": "108 Chapter Two. Vector Spaces\nII Linear Independence\nThe prior section shows how to understand a vector space as a span, as an\nunrestricted linear combination of some of its elements. For example, the space\nof linear polynomials {a+bx|a,b∈R} is spanned by the set {1,x}. The prior\nsection also showed that a space can have many sets that span it. Two more\nsets that span the space of linear polynomials are {1,2x} and {1,x,2x}.\nAt the end of that section we described some spanning sets as ‘minimal’\nbut we never precisely defined that word. We could mean that a spanning\nset is minimal if it contains the smallest number of members of any set with\nthe same span, so that {1,x,2x} is not minimal because it has three members\nwhile we can give two-element sets spanning the same space. Or we could mean\nthat a spanning set is minimal when it has no elements that we can remove\nwithoutchangingthespan. Underthismeaning{1,x,2x}isnotminimalbecause\nremoving the 2x to get {1,x} leaves the span unchanged.\nThe first sense of minimality appears to be a global requirement, in that\nto check if a spanning set is minimal we seemingly must look at all the sets\nthat span and find one with the least number of elements. The second sense\nof minimality is local since we need to look only at the set and consider the\nspan with and without various elements. For instance, using the second sense\nwe could compare the span of {1,x,2x} with the span of {1,x} and note that 2x\nis a “repeat” in that its removal doesn’t shrink the span.\nIn this section we will use the second sense of ‘minimal spanning set’ because\nof this technical convenience. However, the most important result of this book\nis that the two senses coincide. We will prove that in the next section.\nII.1 Definition and Examples\nWe saw “repeats” in the first chapter. There, Gauss’s Method turned them into\n0=0 equations.\n1.1 Example Recall the Statics example from Chapter One’s opening. We got\ntwo balances with the pair of unknown-mass objects, one at 40 cm and 15 cm\nand another at −50 cm and 25 cm, and we then computed the value of those\nmasses. Had we instead gotten the second balance at 20 cm and 7.5 cm then\nGauss’s Method on the resulting two-equations, two-unknowns system would\nnot have yielded a solution, it would have yielded a 0=0 equation along with\nan equation containing a free variable. Intuitively, the problem is that (20 7.5)\nis half of (40 15), that is, (20 7.5) is in the span of the set {(40 15)} and so is"

It is about the trivial sum, the sum of the empty set.\nOne way to see how to define the trivial sum is to consider the progression\n(cid:126)v +(cid:126)v +(cid:126)v , followed by(cid:126)v +(cid:126)v , followed by(cid:126)v . The difference between the\n1 2 3 1 2 1\nsum of three vectors and the sum of two is(cid:126)v . Then the difference between the\n3\nsum of two and the sum of one is(cid:126)v . In next passing to the trivial sum, the\n2\nsum of zero-many vectors, we can expect to subtract(cid:126)v . So we define the sum\n1\nof zero-many vectors to be the zero vector.\nThe relation with the prior example is that if the zero vector is in a set then\nthat set has an element that is a combination of a subset of other vectors from\nthe set, specifically, the zero vector is a combination of the empty subset. Even\nthe set S={(cid:126)0} is linearly dependent, because(cid:126)0 is the sum of the empty set and\nthe empty set is a subset of S.\n1.13 Remark The definition of linear independence, Definition 1.4, refers to a\n‘set’ of vectors. Sets are the most familiar kind of collection and in practice\neveryone refers to these collections as sets. But to be complete we will note that\nsets are not quite the right kind of collection for this purpose.\nRecallthatasetisacollectionwithtwoproperties: (i)orderdoesnotmatter,\nso that the set {1,2} equals the set {2,1}, and (ii) duplicates collapse, so that\nthe set {1,1,2} equals the set {1,2}.\nNow consider this matrix reduction.\n   \n1 1 1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 (1 −/2 →)ρ2 1 1 1\n   \n1 2 3 1 2 3\nOn the left the set of matrix rows {(1 1 1),(2 2 2),(1 2 3)} is linearly de-\npendent.

So we cannot talk about “the” basis for a vector\nspace. True, some vector spaces have bases that strike us as more natural than\nothers, for instance, R2’s basis E or P ’s basis (cid:104)1,x,x2(cid:105). But for the vector\n2 2\nspace {a x2+a x+a |2a −a =a }, no particular basis leaps out at us as\n2 1 0 2 0 1\nthe natural one. We cannot, in general, associate with a space any single basis\nthat best describes it.\nWe can however find something about the bases that is uniquely associated\nwith the space. This subsection shows that any two bases for a space have the\nsame number of elements. So with each space we can associate a number, the\nnumber of vectors in any of its bases.\nBefore we start, we first limit our attention to spaces where at least one basis\nhas only finitely many members.\n2.1 Definition A vector space is finite-dimensional if it has a basis with only\nfinitely many vectors.\nOne space that is not finite-dimensional is the set of polynomials with real\ncoefficients, Example 1.11. This is not spanned by any finite subset since that\nwould contain a polynomial of largest degree but this space has polynomials\nof all degrees. Such spaces are interesting and important but we will focus\nin a different direction. From now on we will study only finite-dimensional\nvector spaces. In the rest of this book we shall take ‘vector space’ to mean\n‘finite-dimensional vector space’.\nTo prove the main theorem we shall use a technical result, the Exchange\nLemma. We first illustrate it with an example."

Hence, row-equivalent\nmatrices have the same row space and therefore the same row rank.\nProof Corollary One.III.2.4 shows that when A−→B then each row of B is a\nlinear combination of the rows of A. That is, in the above terminology, each row\nof B is an element of the row space of A. Then Rowspace(B) ⊆ Rowspace(A)\nfollows because a member of the set Rowspace(B) is a linear combination of the\nrows of B, so it is a combination of combinations of the rows of A, and by the\nLinear Combination Lemma is also a member of Rowspace(A).\nFor the other set containment, recall Lemma One.III.1.5, that row opera-\ntions are reversible so A−→B if and only if B−→A. Then Rowspace(A) ⊆\nRowspace(B) follows as in the previous paragraph. QED\nOf course, Gauss’s Method performs the row operations systematically, with\nthe goal of echelon form."

It is required only for the last sections of\nChapter Three and Chapter Five and for occasional exercises. You can\npass it over without loss of continuity.\nOne way to understand something is to see how to build it from component\nparts. For instance, we sometimes think of R3 put together from the x-axis,\nthe y-axis, and z-axis. In this subsection we will describe how to decompose a\nvector space into a combination of some of its subspaces. In developing this idea\nof subspace combination, we will keep the R3 example in mind as a prototype.\nSubspacesaresubsetsandsetscombineviaunion. Buttakingthecombination\noperation for subspaces to be the simple set union operation isn’t what we want.\nFor instance, the union of the x-axis, the y-axis, and z-axis is not all of R3. In\nfact this union is not a subspace because it is not closed under addition: this\nvector\n       \n1 0 0 1\n0+1+0=1\n       \n0 0 1 1\nis in none of the three axes and hence is not in the union. Therefore to combine\nsubspaces, in addition to the members of those subspaces, we must at least also\ninclude all of their linear combinations.\n4.1 Definition Where W ,...,W are subspaces of a vector space, their sum is\n1 k\nthe span of their union W +W +···+W =[W ∪W ∪···W ].\n1 2 k 1 2 k\nWriting ‘+’ fits with the conventional practice of using this symbol for a natural\naccumulation operation.\n4.2 Example Our R3 prototype works with this. Any vector w(cid:126) ∈R3 is a linear\ncombination c (cid:126)v +c (cid:126)v +c (cid:126)v where(cid:126)v is a member of the x-axis, etc., in this\n1 1 2 2 3 3 1\nway\n       \nw w 0 0\n1 1\nw =1· 0 +1·w +1· 0 \n 2    2  \nw 0 0 w\n3 3\nand so x-axis+y-axis+z-axis=R3.\n4.3 Example A sum of subspaces can be less than the entire space.

In the familiar decomposition of R3, we\noften speak of a vector’s ‘x part’ or ‘y part’ or ‘z part’. That is, in our prototype\neach vector has a unique decomposition into pieces from the parts making up\nthe whole space. But in the decomposition used in Example 4.4, we cannot refer\nto the “xy part” of a vector—these three sums\n             \n1 1 0 1 0 1 0\n2=2+0=0+2=1+1\n             \n3 0 3 0 3 0 3\nall describe the vector as comprised of something from the first plane plus\nsomething from the second plane, but the “xy part” is different in each.\nThat is, when we consider how R3 is put together from the three axes we\nmight mean “in such a way that every vector has at least one decomposition,”\nwhich gives the definition above. But if we take it to mean “in such a way\nthat every vector has one and only one decomposition” then we need another\ncondition on combinations. To see what this condition is, recall that vectors are\nuniquely represented in terms of a basis. We can use this to break a space into a\nsum of subspaces such that any vector in the space breaks uniquely into a sum\nof members of those subspaces.\n4.5Example ConsiderR3 withitsstandardbasisE =(cid:104)(cid:126)e ,(cid:126)e ,(cid:126)e (cid:105).

One such set, gotten from setting p =1 and p =0\n1 4\nand also setting p = 0 and p = 1 is {Π =pr−3/2m1/2G1/2, Π =m−1m }.\n1 4 1 1 2 1 2\nWith that, Buckingham’s Theorem says that any complete relationship among\nthese quantities is stateable this form.\nr3/2\np=r3/2m−1/2G−1/2·fˆ(m−1m )= √ ·fˆ(m /m )\n1 1 2 Gm 2 1\n1\nRemark. An important application of the prior formula is when m is the\n1\nmassofthesunandm isthemassofaplanet. Becausem isverymuchgreater\n2 1\nthan m , the argument to fˆis approximately 0, and we can wonder whether\n2\nthis part of the formula remains approximately constant as m varies. One way\n2\nto see that it does is this. The sun is so much larger than the planet that the\nmutual rotation is approximately about the sun’s center. If we vary the planet’s\nmass m by a factor of x (e.g., Venus’s mass is x=0.815 times Earth’s mass),\n2\nthen the force of attraction is multiplied by x, and x times the force acting on\nx times the mass gives, since F = ma, the same acceleration, about the same\ncenter (approximately). Hence, the orbit will be the same and so its period\nwill be the same, and thus the right side of the above equation also remains\nunchanged (approximately). Therefore, fˆ(m /m ) is approximately constant as\n2 1\nm varies. This is Kepler’s Third Law: the square of the period of a planet is\n2\nproportional to the cube of the mean radius of its orbit about the sun.\nThe final example was one of the first explicit applications of dimensional\nanalysis. Lord Raleigh considered the speed of a wave in deep water and\nsuggested these as the relevant quantities."

So a matrix can\nrepresent many maps.

That is, a linear map is nonsingular if and only if it is an\nisomorphism.\n2.8 Remark Some authors use ‘nonsingular’ as a synonym for one-to-one while\nothers use it the way that we have here. The difference is slight because any\nmap is onto its range space, so a one-to-one map is an isomorphism with its\nrange.\nIn the first chapter we defined a matrix to be nonsingular if it is square and\nis the matrix of coefficients of a linear system with a unique solution. The next\nresult justifies our dual use of the term.\n2.9 Lemma A nonsingular linear map is represented by a square matrix. A\nsquare matrix represents nonsingular maps if and only if it is a nonsingular\nmatrix. Thus, a matrix represents isomorphisms if and only if it is square and\nnonsingular.\nProof Assume that the map h: V →W is nonsingular. Corollary 2.6 says that\nfor any matrix H representing that map, because h is onto the number of rows\nof H equals the rank of H, and because h is one-to-one the number of columns\nof H is also equal to the rank of H. Hence H is square.\nNext assume that H is square, n×n. The matrix H is nonsingular if\nand only if its row rank is n, which is true if and only if H’s rank is n by\nTheorem Two.III.3.11, which is true if and only if h’s rank is n by Theorem 2.4,\nwhich is true if and only if h is an isomorphism by Theorem I.2.3. (This last\nholds because the domain of h is n-dimensional as it is the number of columns\nin H.)

Briefly: m×r times r×n equals m×n.\n2.8 Remark The order of the dimensions can be confusing. In ‘m×r times r×\nn equals m×n’ the number written first is m. But m appears last in the map\ndimension description line (∗) above, and the other dimensions also appear in\nreverse. The explanation is that while h is done first, followed by g, we write\nthe composition as g◦h, with g on the left (arising from the notation g(h((cid:126)v))).\nThat carries over to matrices, so that g◦h is represented by GH.\nWe can get insight into matrix-matrix product operation by studying how\nthe entries combine. For instance, an alternative way to understand why we\nrequire above that the sizes match is that the row of the left-hand matrix must\nhave the same number of entries as the column of the right-hand matrix, or else\nsome entry will be left without a matching entry from the other matrix.\nAnother aspect of the combinatorics of matrix multiplication, in the sum\ndefining the i,j entry, is brought out here by the boxing the equal subscripts.\np =g h +g h +···+g h\ni,j i,1 1,j i,2 2,j i,r r,j\nThe highlighted subscripts on the g’s are column indices while those on the h’s\nare for rows.

Because it represents a function\nthat is invertible, the matrix itself is invertible, and so is nonsingular.\nFor ‘if’ we will show that any nonsingular matrix M performs a change of\nbasis operation from any given starting basis B (having n vectors, where the\nmatrix is n×n) to some ending basis.\nIf the matrix is the identity I then the statement is obvious.

Recall that the prior subsection shows that\na matrix is a change of basis matrix if and only if it is nonsingular.\n2.4 Definition Same-sized matrices H and Hˆ are matrix equivalent if there are\nnonsingular matrices P and Q such that Hˆ =PHQ.\n2.5 Corollary Matrix equivalent matrices represent the same map, with respect\nto appropriate pairs of bases.\nProof This is immediate from equation (∗) above. QED\nExercise 24 checks that matrix equivalence is an equivalence relation. Thus\nit partitions the set of matrices into matrix equivalence classes.\nAll matrices:\nH H matrix equivalent\nHˆ ... to Hˆ\nWe can get insight into the classes by comparing matrix equivalence with row\nequivalence (remember that matrices are row equivalent when they can be\nreduced to each other by row operations). In Hˆ =PHQ, the matrices P and Q\nare nonsingular and thus each is a product of elementary reduction matrices\nby Lemma IV.4.7. Left-multiplication by the reduction matrices making up P\nperformsrowoperations. Right-multiplicationbythereductionmatricesmaking\nup Q performs column operations. Hence, matrix equivalence is a generalization\nof row equivalence—two matrices are row equivalent if one can be converted to\nthe other by a sequence of row reduction steps, while two matrices are matrix\nequivalent if one can be converted to the other by a sequence of row reduction\nsteps followed by a sequence of column reduction steps.\nConsequently, if matrices are row equivalent then they are also matrix\nequivalentsincewecantakeQtobetheidentitymatrix. Theconverse, however,\ndoes not hold: two matrices can be matrix equivalent but not row equivalent.\n2.6 Example These two are matrix equivalent\n(cid:32) (cid:33) (cid:32) (cid:33)\n1 0 1 1\n0 0 0 0"

The first is a basis for\nM k+1 n\nM so if we show that the second is a basis for M⊥ then we will have that the\nentire space is the direct sum.\nExercise 22 from the prior subsection proves this about any orthogonal\nbasis: each vector(cid:126)v in the space is the sum of its orthogonal projections into\nthe lines spanned by the basis vectors.\n(cid:126)v=proj ((cid:126)v)+···+proj ((cid:126)v) (∗)\n[(cid:126)κ1] [(cid:126)κn]\nTo check this, represent the vector as(cid:126)v=r (cid:126)κ +···+r (cid:126)κ , apply(cid:126)κ to both\n1 1 n n i\nsides(cid:126)v•(cid:126)κ\ni\n= (r 1(cid:126)κ 1+···+r n(cid:126)κ n)•(cid:126)κ\ni\n= r 1·0+···+r i·((cid:126)κ i•(cid:126)κ i)+···+r n·0,\nand solve to get r\ni\n=((cid:126)v•(cid:126)κ i)/((cid:126)κ i•(cid:126)κ i), as desired.\nAny member of the span of D is orthogonal to any vector in M so the span\nof D is a subset of M⊥. To show that D is a basis for M⊥ we need only show\nthe other containment, that any w(cid:126) ∈M⊥ is an element of the span of D. The\nprior paragraph works for this. Any w(cid:126) ∈M⊥ gives this on projections into basis\nvectors from M: proj (w(cid:126) )=(cid:126)0,..., proj (w(cid:126) )=(cid:126)0. Therefore equation (∗)\n[(cid:126)κ1] [(cid:126)κk]\ngives that w(cid:126) is a linear combination of(cid:126)κ ,...,(cid:126)κ . Thus D is a basis for M⊥\nk+1 n\nand Rn is the direct sum of the two.\nThe final sentence of the lemma is proved in much the same way. Write\n(cid:126)v = proj ((cid:126)v)+···+proj ((cid:126)v). Then proj ((cid:126)v) keeps only the M part\n[(cid:126)κ1] [(cid:126)κn] M\nand drops the M⊥ part: proj ((cid:126)v)=proj ((cid:126)v)+···+proj ((cid:126)v).

QED\nGiven a subspace, we could compute the orthogonal projection into that\nsubspace by following the steps of that proof: finding a basis, expanding it\nto a basis for the entire space, applying Gram-Schmidt to get an orthogonal\nbasis, and projecting into each linear subspace. However we will instead use a\nconvenient formula.\n3.8 Theorem Let M be a subspace of Rn with basis (cid:104)β(cid:126) ,...,β(cid:126) (cid:105) and let A be\n1 k\nthe matrix whose columns are the β(cid:126)’s.

Thus, even in higher dimensions the\ngeometry of linear maps is easy: it is built by putting together a number of\ncomponents, each of which acts in a simple way.\nWe will apply this understanding in two ways. The first way is to prove\nsomething general about the geometry of linear maps. Recall that under a linear\nmap, the image of a subspace is a subspace and thus the linear transformation\nh represented by H maps lines through the origin to lines through the origin.\n(The dimension of the image space cannot be greater than the dimension of the\ndomain space, so a line can’t map onto, say, a plane.) We will show that h maps\nany line—not just one through the origin—to a line. The proof is simple: the\npartial-identity projection B and the elementary T ’s each turn a line input into\ni\na line output; verifying the four cases is Exercise 5.

Below is a picture of the action of\nthe one-variable real function y(x) = x2+x. As with the nonlinear functions\npictured earlier, the geometric effect of this map is irregular in that at different\ndomain points it has different effects; for example as the input x goes from 2 to\n−2, the associated output f(x) at first decreases, then pauses for an instant, and\nthen increases.\n5 5\n0 0\nBut in Calculus we focus less on the map overall and more on the local effect\nof the map.

That is, in\na neighborhood of x=1, in carrying the domain over this map causes it to grow\nby a factor of 3—it is, locally, approximately, a dilation.

For example(cid:126)v(cid:55)→2(cid:126)v does not\npreserve distances.\nBut there is a neat characterization: a linear transformation t of the plane\nis distance-preserving if and only if both (cid:107)t((cid:126)e )(cid:107) = (cid:107)t((cid:126)e )(cid:107) = 1, and t((cid:126)e ) is\n1 2 1\northogonal to t((cid:126)e ). The ‘only if’ half of that statement is easy—because t\n2\nis distance-preserving it must preserve the lengths of vectors and because t\nis distance-preserving the Pythagorean theorem shows that it must preserve\northogonality. To show the ‘if’ half we can check that the map preserves lengths\nof vectors because then for all(cid:126)p and(cid:126)q the distance between the two is preserved\n(cid:107)t((cid:126)p−(cid:126)q)(cid:107)=(cid:107)t((cid:126)p)−t((cid:126)q)(cid:107)=(cid:107)(cid:126)p−(cid:126)q(cid:107).

Given a square\nmatrix M, fix some way of performing Gauss’s Method to bring the matrix\nto echelon form (it does not matter that there are multiple ways, just fix one\nof them). By using this fixed reduction as in the above examples—keeping\ntrack of row-scaling factors and how the sign alternates on row swaps, and then\nmultiplying down the diagonal of the echelon form result—we can compute the\nvalue that these two functions must return on M, and they must return the\nsame value. Since they give the same output on every input, they are the same\nfunction.

Definition 337\nI.3 The Permutation Expansion\nThe prior subsection defines a function to be a determinant if it satisfies four\nconditions and shows that there is at most one n×n determinant function for\neach n. What is left is to show that for each n such a function exists.\nBut, we easily compute determinants: we use Gauss’s Method, keeping track\nof the sign changes from row swaps, and end by multiplying down the diagonal.\nHow could they not exist?\nThe difficulty is to show that the computation gives a well-defined—that\nis, unique—result. Consider these two Gauss’s Method reductions of the same\nmatrix, the first without any row swap\n(cid:32) (cid:33) (cid:32) (cid:33)\n1 2 −3 −ρ1→+ρ2 1 2\n3 4 0 −2\nand the second with one.\n(cid:32) (cid:33) (cid:32) (cid:33) (cid:32) (cid:33)\n1 2 ρ1−↔ →ρ2 3 4 −(1/ −3) →ρ1+ρ2 3 4\n3 4 1 2 0 2/3\nBoth yield the determinant −2 since in the second one we note that the row\nswap changes the sign of the result we get by multiplying down the diagonal.\nThe fact that we are able to proceed in two ways opens the possibility that the\ntwo give different answers. That is, the way that we have given to compute\ndeterminantvaluesdoesnotplainlyeliminatethepossibilitythattheremightbe,\nsay, tworeductionsofsome7×7matrixthatleadtodifferentdeterminantvalues.\nIn that case we would not have a function, since the definition of a function is\nthat for each input there must be exactly associated one output. The rest of\nthis section shows that the definition Definition 2.1 never leads to a conflict.\nTodothiswewilldefineanalternativewaytofindthevalueofadeterminant.\n(This alternative is less useful in practice because it is slow. But it is very useful\nfor theory.) The key idea is that condition (3) of Definition 2.1 shows that the\ndeterminant function is not linear.\n3.1 Example With condition (3) scalars come out of each row separately,\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12) 4 2(cid:12) (cid:12) 2 1(cid:12) (cid:12) 2 1(cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)=2·(cid:12) (cid:12)=4·(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)−2 6(cid:12) (cid:12)−2 6(cid:12) (cid:12)−1 3(cid:12)\n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)\nnot from the entire matrix at once.

Determinants\n1.5 Theorem A transformation t: Rn →Rn changes the size of all boxes by the\nsame factor, namely, the size of the image of a box |t(S)| is |T| times the size of\nthe box |S|, where T is the matrix representing t with respect to the standard\nbasis.\nThat is, the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants\n|TS|=|T|·|S|.\nThe two sentences say the same thing, first in map terms and then in matrix\nterms. This is because |t(S)| = |TS|, as both give the size of the box that is\nthe image of the unit box E under the composition t◦s, where the maps\nn\nare represented with respect to the standard basis.

ObservethatifTSisinvertiblethenthereisanMsuchthat(TS)M=I,\nso T(SM)=I, and so T is invertible. The contrapositive of that observation is\nthat if T is not invertible then neither is TS—if |T|=0 then |TS|=0.\nNow consider the case that T is nonsingular. Any nonsingular matrix factors\ninto a product of elementary matrices T =E E ···E . To finish this argument\n1 2 r\nwe will verify that |ES|=|E|·|S| for all matrices S and elementary matrices E.\nThe result will then follow because |TS| = |E ···E S| = |E |···|E | · |S| =\n1 r 1 r\n|E ···E |·|S|=|T|·|S|.\n1 r\nThere are three types of elementary matrix.

        "content": "Topic\nSpeed of Calculating Determinants\nFor large matrices, finding the determinant by using row operations is typically\nmuch faster than using the permutation expansion. We make this statement\nprecise by finding how many operations each method performs.\nTo compare the speed of two algorithms, we find for each one how the time\ntaken grows as the size of its input data set grows. For instance, if we increase\nthe size of the input by a factor of ten does the time taken grow by a factor of\nten, or by a factor of a hundred, or by a factor of a thousand? That is, is the\ntime taken proportional to the size of the data set, or to the square of that size,\nor to the cube of that size, etc.? An algorithm whose time is proportional to the\nsquare is faster than one that takes time proportional to the cube.\nFirst consider the permutation expansion formula.\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)t t ... t (cid:12)\n(cid:12) 1,1 1,2 1,n(cid:12)\n(cid:12)t t ... t (cid:12) (cid:88)\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)\n2,1 2 .\n.\n.,2 2,n(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)= t 1,φ(1)t 2,φ(2)···t n,φ(n)|P φ|\n(cid:12) (cid:12) permutationsφ\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\n(cid:12)t n,1 t n,2 ... t n,n(cid:12)\nThere are n!=n·(n−1)···2·1 different n-permutations so for a matrix with\nn rows this sum has n! terms (and inside each term is n-many multiplications).\nThe factorial function grows quickly: when n is only 10 the expansion already\nhas 10!=3,628,800 terms. Observe that growth proportional to the factorial is\nbigger than growth proportional to the square n!>n2 because multiplying the\nfirsttwofactorsinn!givesn·(n−1), whichforlargenisapproximatelyn2 and\nthen multiplying in more factors will make the factorial even larger. Similarly,\nthe factorial function grows faster than n3, etc. So an algorithm that uses the\npermutation expansion formula, and thus performs a number of operations at\nleast as large as the factorial of the number of rows, would be very slow.\nIn contrast, the time taken by the row reduction method does not grow\nso fast.

Thus if N were to\nbe similar to a diagonal matrix D then D would have at least one nonzero entry\non its diagonal.\nThe crucial point is that a power of N is the zero matrix, specifically N2 is\nthe zero matrix. This implies that for any map n represented by N with respect\nto some B,B, the composition n◦n is the zero map. This in turn implies that\nany matrix representing n with respect to some Bˆ,Bˆ has a square that is the\nzero matrix. But for any nonzero diagonal matrix D2, the entries of D2 are the\nsquares of the entries of D, so D2 cannot be the zero matrix.

So if the\ndimensions of the range spaces shrink then the dimensions of the null spaces\nmustrise. WewilldotherangespacehalfhereandleavetherestforExercise14.\nWe start by showing that the range spaces form a chain. If w(cid:126) ∈R(tj+1), so\nthat w(cid:126) =tj+1((cid:126)v) for some(cid:126)v, then w(cid:126) =tj(t((cid:126)v)). Thus w(cid:126) ∈R(tj).\nNext we verify the “further” property: in the chain the subsets containments\nare proper initially, and then from some power k onward the range spaces\nare equal. We first show that if any pair of adjacent range spaces in the\nchain are equal R(tk) = R(tk+1) then all subsequent ones are also equal\nR(tk+1) = R(tk+2), etc. This holds because t: R(tk+1)→R(tk+2) is the\nsame map, with the same domain, as t: R(tk)→R(tk+1) and it therefore has\nthesamerangeR(tk+1)=R(tk+2)(itholdsforallhigherpowersbyinduction).\nSoifthechainofrangespaceseverstopsstrictlydecreasingthenfromthatpoint\nonward it is stable.\nWe end by showing that the chain must eventually stop decreasing. Each\nrange space is a subspace of the one before it. For it to be a proper subspace it\nmust be of strictly lower dimension (see Exercise 12). These spaces are finite-\ndimensional and so the chain can fall for only finitely many steps. That is, the\npower k is at most the dimension of V.

Clause (1) is true because any transformation satisfies\nthat its rank plus its nullity equals the dimension of the space, and in particular\nthis holds for the transformation tn.\nFor clause (2), assume that(cid:126)v∈R ∞(t)∩N ∞(t) to prove that(cid:126)v=(cid:126)0. Because\n(cid:126)v is in the generalized null space, tn((cid:126)v)=(cid:126)0. On the other hand, by the lemma\nt: R ∞(t)→R ∞(t) is one-to-one and a composition of one-to-one maps is one-\nto-one, so tn: R ∞(t)→R ∞(t) is one-to-one. Only (cid:126)0 is sent by a one-to-one\nlinear map to(cid:126)0 so the fact that tn((cid:126)v)=(cid:126)0 implies that(cid:126)v=(cid:126)0.

But the difference is small\nbecause the second is the restriction of the first to R ∞(t).\nFor powers between j = 0 and j = n, the space V might not be the direct\nsum of R(tj) and N (tj).

Then tk sends any vector to(cid:126)0, and that must include including the vector\nstarting any string. So each string in the string basis has length at most k.\nNow instead suppose that the space has a t-string basis B where all of the\nstrings are shorter than length k. Because t has the index of nilpotency k, there\nis a(cid:126)v such that tk−1((cid:126)v)(cid:54)=(cid:126)0. Represent(cid:126)v as a linear combination of elements\nfrom B and apply tk−1. We are supposing that tk−1 maps each element of B\nto(cid:126)0. It therefore maps each term in the linear combination to(cid:126)0, contradicting\nthat it does not map(cid:126)v to(cid:126)0. QED\nWe shall show that each nilpotent map has an associated string basis, a basis\nof disjoint strings.\nTo see the main idea of the argument, imagine that we want to construct\na counterexample, a map that is nilpotent but without an associated basis of\ndisjoint strings.

Jordan Form 445\nWe refer to that result by saying that a matrix or map satisfies its charac-\nteristic polynomial.\n1.10 Lemma Any polynomial that is satisfied by T is divisible by T’s minimal\npolynomial. That is, for a polynomial f(x), if f(T) is the zero matrix then f(x)\nis divisible by the minimal polynomial of T.\nProof Let m(x) be minimal for T. The Division Theorem for Polynomials gives\nf(x)=q(x)·m(x)+r(x) where the degree of r is strictly less than the degree of\nm. Because T satisfies both f and m, plugging T into that equation gives that\nr(T) is the zero matrix. That contradicts the minimality of m unless r is the\nzero polynomial. QED\nCombining the prior two lemmas shows that the minimal polynomial divides\nthe characteristic polynomial. Thus any root of the minimal polynomial is also\na root of the characteristic polynomial.\nThus so far we have that if the minimal polynomial factors as m(x) =\n(x−λ 1)q1···(x−λ i)qi then the characteristic polynomial also has the roots λ 1,\n..., λ .

This suggests doing the proof by induction since the\n2 3\ndimension of the range space R(t−3) is less than that of the starting space.\nProof We will do induction on n. The n=1 base case is trivial since any 1×1\nmatrixisinJordanform. Fortheinductivestepassumethateverytransformation\nof C1, ..., Cn−1 has a Jordan form representation and fix t: Cn →Cn.\nAny transformation has at least one eigenvalue λ because it has a minimal\n1\npolynomial, which has at least one root over the complex numbers. That\neigenvalue has a nonzero eigenvector (cid:126)v, so that (t − λ )((cid:126)v) = (cid:126)0. Thus the\n1\ndimension of N (t−λ ), the map’s nullity, is greater than zero. Since the rank\n1\nplus the nullity equals the dimension of the domain, the rank of t−λ is strictly\n1\nless than n. Write W for the range space R(t−λ ) and write r for the rank, its\n1\ndimension.\nIf w(cid:126) ∈W =R(t−λ ) then w(cid:126) ∈Cn and so (t−λ )(w(cid:126))∈R(t−λ ). Thus\n1 1 1\ntherestrictionoft−λ toW inducesatransformationofW, whichweshallalso\n1\ncall t−λ . The dimension of W is less than n and so the inductive hypothesis\n1\napplies and we get a basis for W consisting of disjoint strings that are associated\nwith the eigenvalues of t−λ on W. For any λ that is an eigenvalue of t−λ ,\n1 1\nthe transformation of the basis elements will be (t−λ )−λ = t−(λ −λ),\n1 1\nwhich we will write as t−λ .

We can quickly\n1\ndo these matrix-vector products even if T is large, provided that it is sparse.\nThe second issue is that to avoid generating numbers that are so large that they\noverflow our computer’s capability, we can normalize the(cid:126)v ’s at each step. For\ni\ninstance, we can divide each(cid:126)v by its length (other possibilities are to divide it\ni\nby its largest component, or simply by its first component). We thus implement\nthis method by generating\nw(cid:126) =(cid:126)v /|(cid:126)v |\n0 0 0\n(cid:126)v =Tw(cid:126)\n1 0\nw(cid:126) =(cid:126)v /|(cid:126)v |\n1 1 1\n(cid:126)v =Tw(cid:126)\n2 2\n.\n.\n.\nw(cid:126) =(cid:126)v /|(cid:126)v |\nk−1 k−1 k−1\n(cid:126)v =Tw(cid:126)\nk k\nuntil we are satisfied.

We could decide for instance to stop the iteration\nprocess not after some fixed number of steps, but instead when |(cid:126)v | differs from\nk\n|(cid:126)v | by less than one percent, or when they agree up to the second significant\nk−1\ndigit.\nThe rate of convergence is determined by the rate at which the powers of\n|λ /λ | go to zero, where λ is the eigenvalue of second largest length. If that\n2 1 2\nratio is much less than one then convergence is fast but if it is only slightly\nless than one then convergence can be quite slow.

With that, the\ncancellation will go on for some time.\nThe interaction between the motions can also produce the other normal\nmode behavior, where the bob moves mostly vertically without much rotation,\nif the spring’s motion x(t) produces a twist that opposes the bob’s twist θ(t).\nThe bob will stop rotating, almost, so that its motion is almost entirely vertical.\nTo get the equations of motion in this two degrees of freedom case, we make\nthe same assumption as in the one degree case, that for small displacements\nthe restoring force is proportional to the displacement.

It is true unless P is true while Q is\nfalse. Thus ‘if 7 is prime then 4 is not’ is true while ‘if 7 is prime then 4 is also\nprime’ is false. (Contrary to its use in casual speech, in mathematics ‘if P then\nQ’ does not connote that P precedes Q or causes Q.)\nNote this consequence of the prior paragraph: if P is false then ‘if P then Q’\nis true irrespective of the value of Q: ‘if 4 is prime then 7 is prime’ and ‘if 4 is\nprime then 7 is not’ are both true statements. (They are vacuously true.) Also\nobserve that ‘if P then Q’ is true when Q is true: ‘if 4 is prime then 7 is prime’\nand ‘if 4 is not prime then 7 is prime’ are both true.\nThere are two main ways to establish an implication. The first way is\ndirect: assume that P is true and use that assumption to prove Q. For instance,\nto show ‘if a number is divisible by 5 then twice that number is divisible by\n10’ we can assume that the number is 5n and deduce that 2(5n) = 10n. The\nindirect way is to prove the contrapositive statement: ‘if Q is false then P is\nfalse’ (rephrased, ‘Q can only be false when P is also false’). Thus to show ‘if a\nnatural number is prime then it is not a perfect square’ we can argue that if it\nwere a square p =n2 then it could be factored p =n·n where n<p and so\nwouldn’t be prime (p=0 or p=1 don’t satisfy n<p but they are nonprime).\nEquivalentstatements Sometimes,notonlydoesP implyQbutalsoQimpliesP.\nSome ways to say this are: ‘P if and only if Q’, ‘P iff Q’, ‘P and Q are logically\nequivalent’, ‘P is necessary and sufficient to give Q’, ‘P ⇐⇒ Q’. An example is\n‘an integer is divisible by ten if and only if that number ends in 0’.\nAlthough in simple arguments a chain like “P if and only if R, which holds if\nand only if S ...” may be practical, to prove that statements are equivalent we\nmore often prove the two halves ‘if P then Q’ and ‘if Q then P’ separately.\nQuantifiers\nCompare these statements about natural numbers: ‘there is a natural number x\nsuch that x is divisible by x2’ is true, while ‘for all natural numbers x, that x is\ndivisible by x2’ is false.

These are proofs by\nmathematical induction. We will see two examples.\nWe will first prove that 1+2+3+···+n=n(n+1)/2. That formula has\na natural number variable n that is free, meaning that setting n to be 1, or\n2, etc., gives a family of cases of the statement: first that 1 = 1(2)/2, second\nthat 1+2=2(3)/2, etc. Our induction proofs involve statements with one free\nnatural number variable.\nEach such proof has two steps. In the base step we show that the statement\nholds for some intial number i ∈ N. Often this step is a routine verification.\nThe second step, the inductive step, is more subtle; we will show that this\nimplication holds:\nIf the statement holds from n=i up to and including n=k\n(∗)\nthen the statement holds also in the n=k+1 case\n(the first line is the inductive hypothesis). Completing both steps proves that\nthe statement is true for all natural numbers greater than or equal to i."

(Note that we use the same curly brackets\nnotation {...} as for sets.) Thus the multiset {1,2,2} differs from the multiset\n{1,2}. Because order does not matter, these multisets are all equal: {1,2,2},\n{2,1,2}, and {2,2,1}. In this text we only mention multisets in a remark so\ngoing into how to do subsets, unions, or intersections, is beyond our scope.\nSequences In addition to sets and multisets, we also use collections where order\nmatters and where repeats do not collapse. These are sequences, denoted with\nangle brackets: (cid:104)2,3,7(cid:105) (cid:54)= (cid:104)2,7,3(cid:105). A sequence of length 2 is an ordered pair,\nand is often written with parentheses: (π,3). We also sometimes say ‘ordered\ntriple’, ‘ordered 4-tuple’, etc. The set of ordered n-tuples of elements of a set A\nis denoted An. Thus R2 is the set of pairs of reals.\nFunctions A function or map f: D→C is is an association between input\narguments x∈Dandoutputvalues f(x)∈Csubjecttothetherequirementthat\nthe function must be well-defined, that x suffices to determine f(x). Restated,\nthe condition is that if x =x then f(x )=f(x ).\n1 2 1 2\nThe set of all arguments D is f’s domain and the set of output values is\nits range R(f). Often we don’t work with the range and instead work with\na convenient superset, the codomain C. For instance, we might describe the\nsquaring function with s: R→R instead of s: R→R+∪{0}.\nWe picture functions with a bean diagram.\nThe blob on the left is the domain while on the right is the codomain. The\nfunction associates the three points of the domain with three in the codomain.\nNote that by the definition of a function every point in the domain is associated\nwith a unique point in the codomain, but the converse needn’t be true.\nThe association is arbitrary; no formula or algorithm is required, although in\nthis book there typically is one. We often use y to denote f(x). We also use the\nnotation x(cid:55)−→f 16x2−100, read ‘x maps under f to 16x2−100’ or ‘16x2−100\nis the image of x’.\nA map such as x(cid:55)→sin(1/x) is a combinations of simpler maps, here g(y)=\nsin(y) applied to the image of f(x)=1/x. The composition of g: Y →Z with\nf: X→Y, is the map sending x∈X to g(f(x))∈Z. It is denoted g◦f: X→Z.\nThis definition only makes sense if the range of f is a subset of the domain of g."

        "content": "A-8\nAn identity map id: Y →Y defined by id(y)=y has the property that for\nany f: X→Y, the composition id◦f is equal to f. So an identity map plays the\nsame role with respect to function composition that the number 0 plays in real\nnumber addition or that 1 plays in multiplication.\nIn line with that analogy, we define a left inverse of a map f: X→Y to be\na function g: range(f)→X such that g◦f is the identity map on X. A right\ninverse of f is a h: Y →X such that f◦h is the identity.\nFor some f’s there is a map that is both a left and right inverse of f. If such\na map exists then it is unique because if both g and g have this property\n1 2\nthen g (x) = g ◦(f◦g )(x) = (g ◦f)◦g (x) = g (x) (the middle equality\n1 1 2 1 2 2\ncomes from the associativity of function composition) so we call it a two-sided\ninverse or just “the” inverse, and denote it f−1. For instance, the inverse of\nthe function f: R→R given by f(x)=2x−3 is the function f−1: R→R given\nby f−1(x)=(x+3)/2.\nThe superscript notation for function inverse ‘f−1’ fits into a larger scheme.\nFunctions with the same codomain as domain f: X→X can be iterated, so that\nwe can consider the composition of f with itself: f◦f, and f◦f◦f, etc. We write\nf◦f as f2 and f◦f◦f as f3, etc. Note that the familiar exponent rules for real\nnumbers hold: fi◦fj =fi+j and (fi)j =fi·j. Then where f is invertible, writing\nf−1 for the inverse and f−2 for the inverse of f2, etc., gives that these familiar\nexponent rules continue to hold, since we define f0 to be the identity map.\nThe definition of function requires that for every input there is one and only\none associated output value. If a function f: D→C has the additional property\nthat for every output value there is at least one associated input value—that is,\nthe additional property that f’s codomain equals its range C=R(f)—then the\nfunction is onto.\nA function has a right inverse if and only if it is onto. (The f pictured above\nhas a right inverse g: C→D given by following the arrows backwards, from\nright to left. For the codomain point on the top, choose either one of the arrows\nto follow. With that, applying g first followed by f takes elements y ∈ C to\nthemselves, and so is the identity function.)\nIf a function f: D→C has the property that for every output value there is\natmostoneassociatedinputvalue—thatis, ifnotwoargumentsshareanimage\nso that f(x ) = f(x ) implies that x = x —then the function is one-to-one.\n1 2 1 2\nThe bean diagram from earlier illustrates."

Such a function is a correspondence. It associates\none and only one element of the domain with each element of the codomain.\nBecause a composition of one-to-one maps is one-to-one, and a composition of\nonto maps is onto, a composition of correspondences is a correspondence.\nWe sometimes want to shrink the domain of a function. For instance, we\nmay take the function f: R→R given by f(x) = x2 and, in order to have an\ninverse, limit input arguments to nonnegative reals fˆ: R+∪{0}→R. Then fˆis\nthe restriction of f to the smaller domain.\nRelations Some familiar mathematical things, such as ‘<’ or ‘=’, are most\nnaturally understood as relations between things. A binary relation on a set\nA is a set of ordered pairs of elements of A. For example, some elements of\nthe set that is the relation ‘<’ on the integers are (3,5), (3,7), and (1,100).\nAnother binary relation on the integers is equality; this relation is the set\n{...,(−1,1),(0,0),(1,1),...}. Still another example is ‘closer than 10’, the set\n{(x,y)||x−y|<10}. Some members of this relation are (1,10), (10,1), and\n(42,44). Neither (11,1) nor (1,11) is a member.\nThose examples illustrate the generality of the definition. All kinds of\nrelationships (e.g., ‘both numbers even’ or ‘first number is the second with the\ndigits reversed’) are covered.\nEquivalence Relations We shall need to express that two objects are alike in\nsome way. They aren’t identical, but they are related (e.g., two integers that\ngive the same remainder when divided by 2).\nA binary relation {(a,b),...} is an equivalence relation when it satisfies\n(1) reflexivity: any object is related to itself, (2) symmetry: if a is related\nto b then b is related to a, and (3) transitivity: if a is related to b and b is\nrelated to c then a is related to c. Some examples (on the integers): ‘=’ is an\nequivalence relation, ‘<’ does not satisfy symmetry, ‘same sign’ is a equivalence,\nwhile ‘nearer than 10’ fails transitivity.\nPartitions In the ‘same sign’ relation {(1,3),(−5,−7),(0,0),...} there are three"
