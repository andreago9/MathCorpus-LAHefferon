        "Preface\nThis book helps students to master the material of a standard US undergraduate\nﬁrst course in Linear Algebra.\n",
        "The material is standard in that the subjects covered are Gaussian reduction,\nvector spaces, linear maps, determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",
        "Another standard is the book’s audience: sophomores or juniors, usually with\na background of at least one semester of calculus.",
        "The help that it gives to\nstudents comes from taking a developmental approach — this book’s presentation\nemphasizes motivation and naturalness, using many examples.\n",
        "The developmental approach is what most recommends this book so I will\nelaborate.",
        "Courses at the beginning of a mathematics program focus less on\ntheory and more on calculating.",
        "Later courses ask for mathematical maturity: the\nability to follow diﬀerent types of arguments, a familiarity with the themes that\nunderlie many mathematical investigations such as elementary set and function\nfacts, and a capacity for some independent reading and thinking.",
        "Some programs\nhave a separate course devoted to developing maturity but in any case a Linear\nAlgebra course is an ideal spot to work on this transition.",
        "It comes early in a\nprogram so that progress made here pays oﬀlater but it also comes late enough\nso that the classroom contains only students who are serious about mathematics.\n",
        "The material is accessible, coherent, and elegant.",
        "And, examples are plentiful.\n",
        "Helping readers with their transition requires taking the mathematics seri-\nously.",
        "All of the results here are proved.",
        "On the other hand, we cannot assume\nthat students have already arrived and so in contrast with more advanced\ntexts this book is ﬁlled with illustrations of the theory, often quite detailed\nillustrations.\n",
        "Some texts that assume a not-yet sophisticated reader begin with matrix\nmultiplication and determinants.",
        "Then, when vector spaces and linear maps\nﬁnally appear and deﬁnitions and proofs start, the abrupt change brings the\n\nstudents to an abrupt stop.",
        "While this book begins with linear reduction, from\nthe start we do more than compute.",
        "The ﬁrst chapter includes proofs, such as\nthe proof that linear reduction gives a correct and complete solution set.",
        "With\nthat as motivation the second chapter does vector spaces over the reals.",
        "In the\nschedule below this happens at the start of the third week.\n",
        "A student progresses most in mathematics by doing exercises.",
        "The problem\nsets start with routine checks and range up to reasonably involved proofs.",
        "I\nhave aimed to typically put two dozen in each set, thereby giving a selection.",
        "In\nparticular there is a good number of the medium-diﬃcult problems that stretch\na learner, but not too far.",
        "At the high end, there are a few that are puzzles taken\nfrom various journals, competitions, or problems collections, which are marked\nwith a ‘?’",
        "(as part of the fun I have worked to keep the original wording).\n",
        "That is, as with the rest of the book, the exercises are aimed to both build\nan ability at, and help students experience the pleasure of, doing mathematics.\n",
        "Students should see how the ideas arise and should be able to picture themselves\ndoing the same type of work.\n",
        "Applications.",
        "Applications and computing are interesting and vital aspects of the\nsubject.",
        "Consequently, each chapter closes with a selection of topics in those\nareas.",
        "These give a reader a taste of the subject, discuss how Linear Algebra\ncomes in, point to some further reading, and give a few exercises.",
        "They are\nbrief enough that an instructor can do one in a day’s class or can assign them\nas projects for individuals or small groups.",
        "Whether they ﬁgure formally in a\ncourse or not, they help readers see for themselves that Linear Algebra is a tool\nthat a professional must have.\nAvailability.",
        "This book is Free.",
        "See http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra\nfor the license details.",

        "Acknowledgments.",
        "A lesson of software development is that complex projects\nhave bugs and need a process to ﬁx them.",

        "This book’s emphasis on motivation and development, and its availability,\nmake it widely used for self-study.",

        "However, you may ﬁnd some advice useful.\n",

        "In the table of contents I have marked a few subsections as optional if some\ninstructors will pass over them in favor of spending more time elsewhere.\n",
        "Note that in addition to the in-class exams, students in the above course do\ntake-home problem sets that include proofs, such as a veriﬁcation that a set is a\nvector space.",
        "Computations are important but so are the arguments.\n",
        "My main advice is: do many exercises.",
        "I have marked a good sample with\n✓’s in the margin.",
        "Do not simply read the answers — you must try the problems\nand possibly struggle with them.",
        "For all of the exercises, you must justify your\nanswer either with a computation or with a proof.",
        "Be aware that few people\ncan write correct proofs without training; try to ﬁnd a knowledgeable person to\nwork with you.\n\n",
        "Finally, a caution for all students, independent or not: I cannot overemphasize\nthat the statement, “I understand the material but it is only that I have trouble\nwith the problems” shows a misconception.",

        "Inventing a good exercise, one that enlightens as well as tests,\nis a creative act, and hard work.",
        "The inventor deserves recognition.",
        "But texts\nhave traditionally not given attributions for questions.",
